## 📋 Overview

This repository contains the complete implementation and experimental validation for a framework that couples **physics structure-informed learning** with **renewable-energy constraints** to address three challenges in Edge AI deployment:

1. **Hardware over-specification** — reads quantitative deployment requirements (operations, memory, power) a priori from the structured Psi-NN architecture to inform platform selection before any hardware is committed (a specification methodology; for the small models demonstrated here the platform choice is driven by task size rather than by the structure).
2. **Carbon footprint** — right-sizing the platform (Jetson Orin Nano → Nordic nRF52840) yields ~45× lifecycle carbon reduction per device; for the demonstrated small models this is driven by task size rather than by the structure, and solar-constrained training contributes under 1% of it.
3. **Renewable-power feasibility** — characterizes what intermittent training actually does via an orthogonal five-cell decomposition (n=10 seeds, paired bootstrap, 95% CI) across seven physics benchmarks, isolating regularization, budget, and schedule contributions.

### Key Results

## 🔁 Reproduce Everything (One Command)

```bash
python reproduce_paper.py
```

This single entry point regenerates **every table, figure, and headline number**
in the paper into one self-contained tree:

```
paper_artifacts/
├── tables/    Table I, III, IV, V, VI, the κ-sweep, the binding-compute example,
│              and the carbon breakdown  (each as .csv AND .tex)
├── figures/   methodology pipeline, five-cell decomposition, κ-sweep curve
└── data/      all_derived_numbers.json + MANIFEST.md (artifact → paper element)
```

- **Default (archived data, ~seconds, deterministic):** every statistic is
  *recomputed* from the blessed per-seed arrays in `results/` using the documented
  paired bootstrap (mean of per-seed ratios, 10,000 resamples, 95% CI, seed=42) —
  nothing is copied from the manuscript. The carbon headline (238 → 5.35 kg, ~45×)
  is computed from the Table I inputs and Eqs. 56–61, so it is auditable rather than
  asserted.
- **`--retrain`:** re-runs the canonical Burgers three-regime + κ-sweep end-to-end
  (CPU backend, to match the blessed runs) and rebuilds from the fresh JSONs. The
  full seven-problem control-arm sweep that produced the archived JSONs is heavy
  (~25–80 h CPU); the remaining problems are reproduced from their archived per-seed
  data (see `paper_artifacts/data/MANIFEST.md`).

```bash
python reproduce_paper.py --retrain        # regenerate Burgers from scratch
python reproduce_paper.py --outdir my_dir  # choose output directory
```

> The per-problem scripts under `experiments/` remain available for inspection, but
> `reproduce_paper.py` is the recommended, clean-clone-safe route to the paper's
> artifacts.

## 🎯 Key Contributions

### 1. Hardware Requirement Extraction from the Structured Architecture

Reads quantitative, a priori hardware requirements from the structured Psi-NN — the memory footprint from its parameter-tying, symmetry, and sparsity, and throughput and power from its architecture shape:

- **TOPS Requirements** — minimum computational throughput
- **Memory Footprint** — RAM/ROM requirements
- **Power Budget** — average and peak consumption
- **Platform Recommendation** — TinyML, Mid-Range, or High-Performance tiers

> _Methodology note: the extraction is general, but for the small models demonstrated here the dense network already fits the target, so the platform choice is task-size-driven; the structure-specific discriminating value (clustered memory) is prospective, pending the distillation-based clustering of the prior Psi-NN method (not used here)._

### 2. Orthogonal Five-Cell Decomposition of Intermittent Training

A paired decomposition that isolates the contributions of regularization (D→C), budget (C→B), and the interruption schedule (B→E) to training outcomes under renewable intermittency. Under the deterministic 50% duty cycle and lossless Adam-state checkpointing assumed here, the active regime E reduces *by structural identity* to continuous training at the halved budget B — so the B→E contrast is zero by construction rather than an empirical finding about schedules in general. The two load-bearing empirical contrasts are therefore **regularization (D→C)** and **budget (C→B)**, both measured per problem under D-normalization (additive closure verified to residual ≤ 4×10⁻¹⁴). Probing schedule effects beyond this structural identity would require stochastic interruption timing or lossy checkpoints, both of which are out of scope here.

### 3. Budget Sensitivity as the Principal Deployment Risk

The dominant factor in training outcome under solar constraints is **budget sensitivity** — the C→B contrast at matched regularization. It is resolved on five of seven physics benchmarks and spans more than two orders of magnitude (Burgers −3.2% to Advection +620.0%). **No clean predictor emerged across the PDE classes and structural properties tested at n = 7** — this is suggestive but not strong evidence of nonexistence; broader-coverage studies would be needed before this absence could be claimed strongly. Practitioners must therefore measure C→B per problem before committing to renewable-powered training.

### 4. Adaptive Regularization (κ-Mechanism)

A power-responsive regularization amplification scheme: when the active period begins after an interruption, regularization weight is multiplied by `(1 + κ·exp(-t/τ))`. The κ-sweep on Burgers PDE (κ ∈ {0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0}, n=10 seeds) shows a **weak-monotone improvement curve** with point estimates from **−8.5% [−10.3, −6.6] at κ=0 to −11.2% [−13.5, −9.0] at κ=2**, each individually resolved at 95% CI. The endpoint span (−2.7% [−3.3, −2.2]) is also resolved and cross-validates at 0.00 pp against an independent passive-to-active comparison.

### 5. Solar Model Validation (Markov vs. Real PVGIS Data)

The Markov solar model has been validated against location-calibrated PVGIS data for Chemnitz, Germany (50.8°N, n=3 seeds, training loss as model-fidelity metric):

| Solar Panel Area (m²) | Real Duty Cycle | Markov Duty Cycle | Real Degradation | Markov Degradation | Δ (Degradation) |
| --------------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ | --------------- |
| 2 (undersized)        | 0.3%            | 12.9%             | +2035%           | +109%              | Diverges        |
| 10                    | 21.7%           | 36.3%             | +89%             | +60%               | 29 pp           |
| 15 (target)           | 27.4%           | 39.5%             | +68%             | +56%               | **11.3 pp**     |

**Key Finding** (hedged honestly): the Markov model reproduces training-degradation impact to within **11.3 pp** when panels are sized to approximately 50% duty cycle. Agreement is on degradation impact, not on duty-cycle fidelity — the model overestimates the realized duty cycle (Markov: 39.5% vs. real: 27.4%). This is a model-fidelity comparison (training loss) rather than a performance claim; n=3 seeds, indicative not definitive.

To run the validation:

```bash
# Default (2 m² panel — undersized, will fail)
python experiments/pvgis_solar_validation.py --epochs 3000 --seeds 3

# Properly sized for Northern Europe (15 m² panel)
python experiments/pvgis_solar_validation.py --epochs 3000 --seeds 3 \
  --panel-area 15.0 --peak-power 1500.0 \
  --output results/pvgis_validation_15m2
```

### 6. GPU Power Validation

The manuscript uses 250 W as a conservative estimate for RTX 4090 power consumption during training. Empirical measurement shows actual consumption is significantly lower:

| Configuration                                      | Mean Power | Max Power | Min Power | Manuscript Claim | Discrepancy   |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | --------- | --------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| 4×50 neurons, 1000 collocation points, 6000 epochs | **57 W**   | 92 W      | 50 W      | 250 W            | **77% lower** |

**Implication**: PINN training is a lightweight GPU workload. The 250 W assumption is conservative, meaning solar feasibility is more readily achievable in practice than the presented analysis suggests.

```bash
python experiments/measure_gpu_power.py            # quick (500 epochs)
python experiments/measure_gpu_power.py --manuscript   # full (6000 epochs)
# Results saved to results/gpu_power_measurement/
```

### 7. Statistical Validation

- **60+ experiments** across 7 PDE problems (Burgers, Laplace, Heat, Wave, Advection, Allen-Cahn, Memristor)
- **10 independent random seeds** per configuration
- **Paired bootstrap** estimator (mean of per-seed ratios, 10,000 resamples, 95% CI)
- All contrasts D-normalized for Table VI (additive closure residual ≤ 4×10⁻¹⁴); C-normalized for Table IV (budget sensitivity)
- Canonical metric: **test MSE vs. analytical solution** (not training loss)

## 🔬 Experimental Results

### Table V — Passive vs. Continuous (Own-Denominator, test MSE)

Test MSE change at the 50% duty cycle (κ=0, passive) relative to continuous
training at full budget. **Paired bootstrap, n=10 seeds, 95% CI, 10,000 resamples.**

| Problem        | PDE Type                    | Pass-Cont test MSE        | Status      |
| -------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------- |
| **Burgers**    | Parabolic (nonlinear)       | **−8.5% [−10.3, −6.6]**   | improves    |
| Laplace        | Elliptic (steady-state)     | +7.5% [−7, +20]           | unresolved  |
| Allen-Cahn     | Nonlinear reaction-diffusion| +121.2% [+72, +169]       | resolved    |
| Heat           | Parabolic                   | +155.9% [+98, +215]       | resolved    |
| Wave           | Hyperbolic (2nd-order)      | +691.3% [+193, +1462]     | wide CI     |
| Memristor      | ODE (device physics)        | +768.8% [+419, +1149]     | resolved    |
| Advection      | Hyperbolic (1st-order)      | +861.5% [+293, +1615]     | resolved    |

### Table IV — Budget Sensitivity C→B (C-normalized)

The cost of halving the training budget at matched regularization. **5 of 7 resolved at 95% CI.**

| Problem     | C→B Point Estimate | 95% CI            | Status     |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | ---------- |
| Burgers     | **−3.2%**          | [−4, −2]          | resolved   |
| Laplace     | +41.5%             | [+12, +79]        | resolved   |
| Allen-Cahn  | +97.6%             | [+67, +129]       | resolved   |
| Heat        | +176.8%            | [+85, +305]       | resolved   |
| Memristor   | +306.4%            | [−69, +714]       | unresolved |
| Advection   | **+620.0%**        | [+239, +1118]     | resolved   |
| Wave        | +3474%             | [+30, +9677]      | wide CI    |

**Key Finding**: C→B spans more than two orders of magnitude. **No clean predictor emerged
across the PDE classes and structural properties tested at n = 7** (suggestive but
not strong evidence of nonexistence) — parabolic Heat (+176.8%) is the
second-most sensitive problem, exceeded only by transport-dominated Advection
(+620.0%); a parabolic diffusion problem outranking everything but first-order
hyperbolic transport is direct evidence that PDE class does not predict
sensitivity, while Laplace and Burgers stay low-sensitivity. The Memristor's sign reversal
between C-normalization (+306.4%) and D-normalization (−767%) suggests the
estimator is at its lower n-bound for that problem, a further reason to treat the
absence of a predictor as suggestive rather than established. C→B must be measured
per problem.

### Figure 3 — Burgers PDE κ-Sweep (Weak-Monotone Improvement)

The κ-mechanism produces a weak-monotone improvement curve relative to the
continuous baseline. **All five points individually resolved at 95% CI.**

| κ Value | test MSE Change vs. Continuous | 95% CI            |
| ------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------- |

| --------------- | ----- | ----- | ------ | ----------- | -------------- | ------ |
| STM32H7         | 0.082 | $8    | 400 mW | 0.027%      | Over-specified | 214    |

### Carbon Footprint Comparison (5-year lifecycle, per device)

| Scenario              | Training | Deployment | Total       | Reduction   |
| --------------------- | -------- | ---------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **Solar + Nordic nRF52840** | 0.036 kg | 0.31 kg | **~5.35 kg** | **~45× less** |
| Grid + Jetson Orin    | 0.356 kg | 238 kg     | **238 kg**  | baseline    |

**Per-device saving: 233 kg CO₂. ~99.9% of this is from the hardware change
(Jetson → nRF52840); solar-constrained training contributes <1% (~0.32 kg).**

At scale (10,000 devices): ~2,330 metric tons CO₂ saved.
At scale (1M devices): ~233,000 metric tons CO₂ saved.

### Statistical Validation Protocol

All performance contrasts use the same paired bootstrap estimator:

```python
import numpy as np

def paired_bootstrap_ci(num_arr, denom_arr, n_boot=10000, seed=42):
    """Mean of per-seed ratios, 95% percentile CI (10k resamples)."""
    num = np.array(num_arr); den = np.array(denom_arr)
    ratios = (num - den) / den
    point_est = ratios.mean()
    rng = np.random.default_rng(seed)
    idx = rng.integers(0, len(ratios), size=(n_boot, len(ratios)))
    boot = ratios[idx].mean(axis=1)
    lo, hi = np.percentile(boot, [2.5, 97.5])
    return point_est * 100, lo * 100, hi * 100  # return as percentages
```

### Normalization choices (per table)

- **Table V**: own-denominator (each contrast normalized to its own reference)
- **Table VI**: D-normalized (additive closure D→C + C→B + B→E = D→E, residual ≤ 4×10⁻¹⁴)
- **Table IV**: C-normalized (budget sensitivity relative to full-budget at high reg)
- **κ-sweep (Figure 3)**: D-normalized (improvement relative to continuous baseline)

### Expected Runtime

| Experiment             | Seeds       | Epochs  | Wall Clock (CPU)    |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | ------- | ------------------- |
| Single problem         | 1           | 3000    | ~20 minutes         |
| Statistical validation | 10          | 3000    | ~3.5 hours          |
| Full 7-problem sweep   | 10 × 7      | 3000    | ~25 hours           |
| Decomposition (Table VI) | 10 × 4 cells × 7 | 3000 | ~80 hours        |
| κ-sweep (Figure 3)     | 10 × 5      | 3000    | ~14 hours           |

**Note**: Solar-constrained training extends wall-clock time by ~2× due to the
50% duty cycle. All blessed results in the paper are CPU-backend runs to ensure
bit-exact reproducibility across machines.

## 🔍 Key Findings Summary

### ✅ What's established

1. **Hardware right-sizing is the dominant sustainability lever** — of the 233 kg
   per-device carbon saving, ~99.9% comes from the Jetson → Nordic nRF52840 platform
   change (task-size-driven for the demonstrated models); <1% comes from solar-constrained
   training. The headline "solar makes AI greener" framing is corrected.

2. **For Burgers PDE, solar-constrained training has no accuracy penalty** —
   test MSE improves under the κ-mechanism relative to the continuous baseline
   (κ=0 to κ=2 span: −8.5% to −11.2%, all individually resolved at 95% CI).

3. **Under the deterministic 50% duty cycle with lossless Adam-state
   checkpointing, B→E = 0 by structural identity** — the interruption schedule
   reduces by construction to continuous training at the halved budget, not as
   an empirical finding about schedules in general. The load-bearing empirical
   contrasts are regularization (D→C) and budget (C→B); probing schedule effects
   beyond this structural identity would require stochastic timing or lossy
   checkpoints.

### ⚠️ What's a deployment risk

4. **Budget sensitivity (C→B) spans more than two orders of magnitude.**
   Burgers (−3.2%), Laplace (+41.5%), Allen-Cahn (+97.6%), Heat (+176.8%),
   Advection (+620.0%) — 5 of 7 problems resolved; Wave and Memristor have wide
   or unresolved CIs. **No clean predictor emerged across the PDE classes and
   structural properties tested at n = 7** — this is suggestive but not strong
   evidence of nonexistence at the present sample size.
   **Practitioners must measure C→B per problem before committing to renewable-
   powered training.**

5. **Wave and Memristor** are the two unresolved cases: Wave's C→B point estimate
   is very high (+3474%) but its CI is so wide that the contrast is effectively
   uninterpretable; Memristor's CI crosses zero. Both are excluded from the
   resolved-5-of-7 framing for cause.

### 🔬 Methodology robustness

6. The orthogonal decomposition's additive closure (D→C + C→B + B→E = D→E)
   holds to numerical residual (≤ 4×10⁻¹⁴) on all problems where it is measured.
   The κ-sweep cross-validates the κ=2 endpoint at 0.00 pp against an independent
   passive-vs-active comparison.
